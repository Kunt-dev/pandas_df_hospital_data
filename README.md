The hospital data contained too much unneccesasary information. There had to be make a string analysis and match them with the given structure. 
I am not allowed to upload hospital data here buth the code loops through more than 30 excel files to match them with the master excel file and parses the neccessary information. 

This is just a showcase of my python pandas dataframe work.
